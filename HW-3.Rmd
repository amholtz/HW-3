## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Ali Cook
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 6 Hours
* What gave you the most trouble: My logistic regression does not make much 
sense. It is somehow worse than if profiles were chosen at random for gender
* Any comments you have: I do not know how to do 1)d. I'm surprised by
how active the Reed College pool hall jukebox is even during the summer. 


## Data

* You must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from `HW-2` to the `data` folder
in the `HW-3` directory
* We also consider all 222,540 songs played in the Reed College pool hall
jukebox from Nov 30, 2003 to Jan 22, 2009 (included in `HW-3` folder). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("data/profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
jukebox <- read.csv("data/jukebox.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
bitcoin <- Quandl("BAVERAGE/USD") %>% tbl_df()
gold <- Quandl("WGC/GOLD_DAILY_USD") %>% tbl_df()
```



## Question 1:

For this question we will be picking up from where we left off in HW-2,
specifically the OkCupid dataset.


### a)

Using your exploratory data analysis from HW-2, fit a logistic regression to
predict individual's gender and interpret your results.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

find.query <- function(char.vector, query){
  which.has.query <- grep(query, char.vector, ignore.case = TRUE)
  length(which.has.query) != 0
}
profile.has.query <- function(data.frame, query){
  query <- tolower(query)
  has.query <- apply(data.frame, 1, find.query, query=query)
  return(has.query)
}

#Binary scale for male or female
gender <- profiles %>% select(sex, orientation, income, job, height, pets, diet) %>% 
  mutate(is.female = ifelse(sex=="f", 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(is.bisexual = ifelse(orientation == "bisexual", 1, 0))

orientation <- gender %>% select(orientation, orientation, sex, is.female, height, is.bisexual) 


# #orientation2 <-group_by(orientation, orientation, sex) %>% tally() 
# 
# #See relationship of orientation to gender
# #plot1 <- ggplot(orientation2, aes(x = sex, y = n, fill = orientation)) +
#   geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") +
#   labs(title = "Sexual Orientation of Bay Area OKCupid Users by Gender",
#                 x = "Gender", y = "% of Users")
# plot1
# #Here you can see more women than men are "bisexual", while more men than women 
# #identify as "gay". "Straight" observation is split almost 50/50. 
# 
# plot2 <- ggplot(orientation, aes(x = sex, y = height)) +
#   geom_boxplot(width=0.3)
#   #labs(title = "Sexual Orientation of Bay Area OKCupid Users by Gender",
#                 #x = "Gender", y = "% of Users")
# plot2
# From this boxplot, you can see that males are taller than females.

summary(orientation)

# See relationship of both height and sexuality to gender. 
plot3 <- ggplot(data=orientation, aes(x=orientation, y=height, col=sex)) + 
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, height=0.5, alpha = 0.5, size = 0.4) + 
  xlab("Sexuality") + ylab("Height") +
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Gender")
plot3

#Fit logistical regression model
#Question, where did orientationbisexual go?
gender.fit = glm(is.female ~ is.bisexual + height, data=orientation, family=binomial)
kable(summary(gender.fit)$coef,digits=3)


```


### b)

Plot a histogram of the fitted probabilities $\widehat{p}_i$ for all users $i=1,
\ldots, n=59946$ in your dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

p_hat <- predict(gender.fit, orientation, type="response") %>% round(3)

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x=p_hat)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, colour = "#FFEB9A", fill = "#B59926") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5, size = 1, colour = "#1A065B") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of fitted probabilities", x ="pÌ‚", y ="# of Users on OK Cupid") 


```


### c)

Use a *decision threshold* of $p^*=0.5$ to make an explicit prediction for each
user $i$'s sex and save this in a variable `predicted_sex`. In other words, for user $i$

* If $\widehat{p}_i > p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 1` i.e. they are female
* If $\widehat{p}_i < p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 0` i.e. they are male

Display a 2 x 2 contigency table of `sex` and `predicted_sex` i.e. compare the 
predicted sex to the actual sex of all users. The sum of all the elements in
your table should be $n=59946$. Comment on how well our predictions fared.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

gender.prob = predict(gender.fit, orientation, type="response")
gender.pred = rep(1, dim(orientation)[1])
gender.pred[gender.prob > 0.5] = 0

twobytwo <- table(gender.pred, orientation$is.female)
sum(twobytwo)  
kable(twobytwo)


```

I still do not think the linear regression worked correctly. As it currently stands, this model is a horrible predictor. It is more wrong than it is right. 

### d)

Say we wanted to have a **false positive rate** of about 20%, i.e. of the people
we predicted to be female, we want to be wrong no more than 20% of the time. What
decision threshold $p^*$ should we use?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 2:

Using the jukebox data, plot a time series of the number of songs played each
week over the entire time period. i.e.

* On the x-axis present actual dates (not something like Week 93, which doesn't 
mean anything to most people).
* On the y-axis present the total number of songs.

What seasonal (i.e. cyclical) patterns do you observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

week_year <- select(jukebox, date_time, track, artist)

week_year <- week_year %>% mutate(date = parse_date_time(date_time, "%b %d %H%M%S %y" ))  %>% mutate(week= week(date)) %>% mutate(year=year(date))

songs <- week_year %>% group_by(year,week) %>% tally()
songs$date <-as.Date(paste(songs$year, songs$week, 1, sep="-"), "%Y-%U-%u")

plot4 <- ggplot(songs, aes(x = date, y = n)) + geom_area(size= 1, fill = "#4F628E") +labs(title = "Number of songs played each week for 6 consecutive years", x = "Date", y = "Number of songs played") 
ggplotly()


```
You can see from the plot that there are two distinct times of the year when 
there is a drop in songs played. The broader valley is summer and the very 
narrow but deep dip is winter break. The spring seems to have a downward trend. 
The closer to the end of the semester (closer to summer) the fewer songs are 
played. A closer look by making seasonal intervals could tell me more information. 



## Question 3:

Using the jukebox data, what are the top 10 artists played during the "graveyard
shift" during the academic year? Define

* the "graveyard shift" as midnight to 8am
* the academic year as September through May (inclusive)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

week_year <- week_year %>% mutate(hour = hour(date)) %>% mutate(month= month(date))
academic_year <- c(1,2,3,4,5,9,10,11,12)
graveyard_shift <- c(12,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)

gy <- select(week_year, artist, track, month, hour)
gy <- gy %>% filter(month %in% academic_year) %>% 
  filter(hour %in% graveyard_shift) %>%
  group_by(artist) %>% tally() %>% arrange(desc(n)) %>% top_n(10)



top10 <- ggplot(data = gy, aes(x = artist, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#807A15") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "Top 10 Artists during Academic year graveyard shift", 
       x = "Number of times played", y = "Artist")

ggplotly()

```


## Question 4:

We want to compare the volatility of 

* bitcoin prices
* gold prices

Let our measure of volatility be the relative change from day-to-day in price. 
Let the reference currency be US dollars. Analyze these results and provide
insight to a foreign currency exchanger.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

bitcoin

bitcoin <- rename(bitcoin, Avg = `24h Average`, Total.Volume = `Total Volume`)

bitgold <- left_join(bitcoin, gold, by = "Date")

ggplot(data = bitgold, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Avg), colour = "#075189") +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Value), colour = "#D5B000") +
  labs(title = "Average Price of Gold and Bitcoin by Date", x = "Date",
       y = "Avg. Price (USD)")

bitcoin_diff <- diff(bitgold$Avg)
gold_diff <- diff(bitgold$Value)

pander(summary(bitcoin_diff))
pander(summary(gold_diff))


```





## Question 5:

Using the data loaded from Quandl below, plot a time series using `geom_line()`
comparing cheese and milk production in the US from 1930 to today. Comment on this.

* Cheese [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Cheese-Production-Measured-In-Lb)
* Milk [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Milk-Production-Measured-In-Lb)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
cheese <- Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
milk <-  Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
```
