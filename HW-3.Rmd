## Admistrative:

Please indicate

* Who you collaborated with: Ali Cook
* Roughly how much time you spent on this HW: 12 Hours
* What gave you the most trouble: My logistic regression does not make much 
sense. It is somehow worse than if profiles were chosen at random for gender
* Any comments you have: I'm surprised by
how active the Reed College pool hall jukebox is even during the summer. 


## Data

* You must first copy the file `profiles.csv` from `HW-2` to the `data` folder
in the `HW-3` directory
* We also consider all 222,540 songs played in the Reed College pool hall
jukebox from Nov 30, 2003 to Jan 22, 2009 (included in `HW-3` folder). 

```{r, echo=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
# DO NOT EDIT THIS SECTION!
profiles <- read.csv("data/profiles.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()
jukebox <- read.csv("data/jukebox.csv", header=TRUE) %>% 
  tbl_df()

```



## Question 1:

For this question we will be picking up from where we left off in HW-2,
specifically the OkCupid dataset.


### a)

Using your exploratory data analysis from HW-2, fit a logistic regression to
predict individual's gender and interpret your results.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

find.query <- function(char.vector, query){
  which.has.query <- grep(query, char.vector, ignore.case = TRUE)
  length(which.has.query) != 0
}
profile.has.query <- function(data.frame, query){
  query <- tolower(query)
  has.query <- apply(data.frame, 1, find.query, query=query)
  return(has.query)
}

#Binary scale for male or female
gender <- profiles %>%
  select(sex, orientation, income, job, height, pets, diet) %>% 
  mutate(is.female = ifelse(sex=="f", 1, 0)) %>% 
  mutate(is.bisexual = ifelse(orientation == "bisexual", 1, 0))

sexuality <- gender %>% select(orientation, sex, is.female, height, is.bisexual) 

orient_tally <- sexuality %>% 
  group_by(sex, orientation) %>%
  tally()

plot3 <- ggplot(data=orient_tally, aes(x=orientation, y= n, fill = sex)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "fill") + 
  labs(title = "Proportion of Sexual Orientation by Gender", 
       x = "Sexuality",  y ="Proportion of Sexual Orientation") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") 
plot3


#Here you can see that more women define themselves on OKCUpid as bisexual
#than men.There are more men on OKCupid who define themselves 
# as 'gay'. It is important to note that there are more men on OKCupid. 

# See relationship of both height and sexuality to gender. 
plot4 <- ggplot(data=sexuality, aes(x=orientation, y=height, col=sex)) + 
  geom_jitter(width=0.2, height=0.5, alpha = 0.25, size = 0.4) + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of both height and sexual orientation by gender", 
       x = "Sexuality", y = "Height (cm)") + 
  scale_color_discrete(name = "Gender") 
plot4

# I use geom_jitter because I want the viewer to see two main properties of
# the data set. 1.) You can see that men are taller than women. and 2.) You
# you can see that there are more women who define themselves as bisexual
# and more men that define themselves as gay. The distribution is almost equal
# for straight. 

#Fit logistical regression model


#This set "straight" as the reference observation
sexuality <- within(sexuality, orientation 
                    <- relevel(orientation, ref = "straight"))

gender.fit = glm(is.female ~ orientation + height, data=sexuality, family=binomial)

kable(summary(gender.fit)$coef,digits=2)

# I can't figure this out. 
b <- coefficients(gender.fit)

exp_b = exp(b[2:4])
pander(exp_b)

# This means that if there are any individuals that are bisexual, there is a 3.98
# times higher chance that the individual is female. On the contrary, orientationgay
# and height are more correlated to male. 

```

This model attempts to show the relationship between gender, height and sexual
orientation. The idea is that for every change in height and sexual orientation
(specifically bisexuality and gay) there is a change in the odds of being
female. From the regression output, one can see a positive relationship of
bisexuality to the odds of being female. This means that for every 1.382 unit
increase in bisexuality there is a one unit increase in the odds of being
female. This is the opposite for gay and straight. Every 0.678 decrease in gay
results in a 1 unit increase in odds of being female, which means that
increases in gay result in decrease in odds female (negative relationship).
Height and gender also have a negative relationship. A 0.638 unit decrease in
height results in a 1 unit increase in the odds of being female. The exponential
of these coeficients show the increase or decrease in odds for each descripter to gender. For example, if the user is bisexual there is a 3.98 multiplicative
fold increase in the odds of the user being female. On the contrary, if the user
is gay, the odds of the user being female are reduced multiplicatively by 0.507.
This also means that 1/0.507, which is equal to 1.97, is the fold increase of 
the odds that the user is male. A one unit increase in height corresponds to 
a multiplicative increase of 0.5281 in the odds of the user being female. In
other words, there is a multiplicative increase of 1.89 in the odds of the user
being male for every one unit increase in height. 

### b)

Plot a histogram of the fitted probabilities $\widehat{p}_i$ for all users $i=1,
\ldots, n=59946$ in your dataset.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

p_hat <- predict(gender.fit, sexuality, type="response") %>% 
  round(3)

ggplot(data = NULL, aes(x=p_hat)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.2, colour = "#FFEB9A", fill = "#B59926") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.5, size = 1, colour = "#1A065B") +
  labs(title = "Histogram of fitted probabilities", x ="pÌ‚", y ="# of Users on OK Cupid") 

```
Above is a histogram showing the distribution of fitted probabilities 
$\widehat{p}_i$ for OKCupid users. Each bin on the x-axis represents ranges of 
fitted probabilities. $\widehat{p}_i$ of 0.00 to 0.02 is the most 
frequent range of $\widehat{p}_i$

### c)

Use a *decision threshold* of $p^*=0.5$ to make an explicit prediction for each
user $i$'s sex and save this in a variable `predicted_sex`. In other words, for user $i$

* If $\widehat{p}_i > p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 1` i.e. they are female
* If $\widehat{p}_i < p^*$, set `predicted_sex = 0` i.e. they are male

Display a 2 x 2 contigency table of `sex` and `predicted_sex` i.e. compare the 
predicted sex to the actual sex of all users. The sum of all the elements in
your table should be $n=59946$. Comment on how well our predictions fared.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

gender.prob = predict(gender.fit, sexuality, type="response")
gender.pred = rep(0, dim(sexuality)[1])
gender.pred[gender.prob > 0.5] = 1

colnames <- c("Observed Male", "Observed Female")
twobytwo <- table(gender.pred, sexuality$is.female)
rownames(twobytwo) <- c("Predicted Male","Predicted Female")
kable(twobytwo, col.names = colnames, digits = 3 )

#Proportions
rownames(twobytwo) <- c("% Predicted Male","% Predicted Female")
prop_correct <- prop.table(twobytwo,2)
kable((prop_correct)*100, col.names = colnames, digits = 2)

```

This model worked very well. As you can see from the 2x2 table, the model 
predicted correctly 85.2% of the time for male and 81.2% of the time for 
females. The error rate for predicting males was 14.81% and the error rate
for predicted females was 18.8. 

### d)

Say we wanted to have a **false positive rate** of about 20%, i.e. of the people
we predicted to be female, we want to be wrong no more than 20% of the time. What
decision threshold $p^*$ should we use?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

```





## Question 2:

Using the jukebox data, plot a time series of the number of songs played each
week over the entire time period. i.e.

* On the x-axis present actual dates (not something like Week 93, which doesn't 
mean anything to most people).
* On the y-axis present the total number of songs.

What seasonal (i.e. cyclical) patterns do you observe?

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

week_year <- select(jukebox, date_time, track, artist)

week_year <- week_year %>% 
  mutate(date = parse_date_time(date_time, "%b %d %H%M%S %y" ))  %>%
  mutate(week= week(date)) %>% 
  mutate(year=year(date))

songs <- week_year %>% 
  group_by(year,week) %>% 
  tally()

songs$date <-as.Date(paste(songs$year, songs$week, 1, sep="-"), "%Y-%U-%u")

plot4 <- ggplot(songs, aes(x = date, y = n)) + 
  geom_area(size= 1, fill = "#4F628E") +
  labs(title = "Number of songs played each week for 6 consecutive years", 
       x = "Date", y = "Number of songs played")

ggplotly()


```
You can see from the plot that there are two distinct times of the year when 
there is a drop in songs played. The broader valley is summer and the very 
narrow but deep dip is winter break. The spring seems to have a downward trend. 
The closer to the end of the semester (closer to summer) the fewer songs are 
played. 



## Question 3:

Using the jukebox data, what are the top 10 artists played during the "graveyard
shift" during the academic year? Define

* the "graveyard shift" as midnight to 8am
* the academic year as September through May (inclusive)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

week_year <- week_year %>% mutate(hour = hour(date)) %>% mutate(month= month(date))
academic_year <- c(1,2,3,4,5,9,10,11,12)
graveyard_shift <- c(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8)

#look at just the grave_yard shift
gy <- select(week_year, artist, track, month, hour)

gy <- gy %>% 
  filter(month %in% academic_year) %>% 
  filter(hour %in% graveyard_shift) %>%
  group_by(artist) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  top_n(10) %>% 
  arrange((n))

#Look at all times of the day
all <- select(week_year, artist, track, month, hour)

all <- all %>% 
  filter(month %in% academic_year) %>% 
  group_by(artist) %>% 
  tally() %>% 
  top_n(10) %>% 
  arrange((n))


gy$artist <- factor(gy$artist, levels = 
                      gy$artist[order(-gy$n)])

#Plot for artists played during the graveyard shift
top10 <- ggplot(data = gy, aes(x = artist, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#807A15") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "Top 10 Artists during Academic year graveyard shift", 
       x = "Number of times played", y = "Artist")

ggplotly()

all$artist <- factor(all$artist, levels = 
                      all$artist[order(-all$n)])

#Plot for all times of the day. 
top10_non <- ggplot(data = all, aes(x = artist, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#807A15") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  labs(title = "Top 10 Artists during Academic year", 
       x = "Number of times played", y = "Artist")

ggplotly()


```
From the bar plot above, one can see that OutKast is played the most 
during the aademic year of the graveyard shift. Talking Heads is played the 
least. It is interesting how the majority of these music groups are Rock and
Roll. Reed College must not like 'mainstream' music played during wee hours of 
the night. Comparing the graveyard shift's most popular tracks to all hours
of the day, you can see that there isn't much variation. Perhaps this means the
music is actually on some sort of loop. The only difference in most popular

## Question 4:

We want to compare the volatility of 

* bitcoin prices
* gold prices

Let our measure of volatility be the relative change from day-to-day in price. 
Let the reference currency be US dollars. Analyze these results and provide
insight to a foreign currency exchanger.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}

bitcoin <- Quandl("BAVERAGE/USD") %>% tbl_df()
gold <- Quandl("WGC/GOLD_DAILY_USD") %>% tbl_df()

bitcoin <- rename(bitcoin, Avg_bit = `24h Average`, Total.Volume = `Total Volume`)

bitgold <- left_join(bitcoin, gold, by = "Date") %>% 
  select(Date, Avg_bit, Value)

ggplot(data = bitgold, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Avg_bit), colour = "#075189") +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Value), colour = "#D5B000") +
  labs(title = "Plot #1: Average Price of Gold and Bitcoin by Date", x = "Date",
       y = "Avg. Price (USD)")

#remove bitcoin and gold data pre 2013. Since it will
date_range <- interval(ymd(20130101), ymd(20150601))
bitgold2013 <- bitgold %>% 
  filter(Date %within% date_range) %>% 
  arrange(Date)

bitgold2013 <- bitgold2013 %>% 
  mutate(bit_delta = ((Avg_bit - lag(Avg_bit))/(lag(Avg_bit))))
 
bitgold2013 <- bitgold2013 %>% 
  mutate(gold_delta = ((Value - lag(Value))/(lag(Value))))

chng <- ggplot(data = bitgold2013, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = bit_delta), colour = "#075189") +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = gold_delta), colour = "#D5B000", size = 1) +
  labs(title = "Plot #2: Daily % Change of Gold and Bitcoin by Date", x = "Date",
       y = "% Change")
ggplotly()
  


```
From plot #1 produced above you can see that gold consistantly has more value
than bitcoin. In addition, it is visually apparent that gold is more temperate 
than bitcoin. Bitcoin has had an change of $1000 in the last 5 years, while gold
has stayed between $1000 and $2000. Looking at plot #2 you can see the 
volatility of the two graphs. The daily % change of gold and bitcoin, shows how
strickingly different bitcoin and gold are when it comes to variabilies in 
daily price changes. Relative to bitcoin, gold strattles 0% change. The highest
daily % change for gold was 4.96% while the highest % change for bitcoin was
29.8%. Therefore, you can come to the conclusion that bicoin is more volatile 
than gold. It is important to mention that gold changes prices less often, since
the price of gold does not change on weekends. The price of Bitcoins does change
over the weekend. If I were given advice to a foreign currency exchanger, I 
would let him/her know that they have the greatest chance to make a profit with 
bitcoin, but it is much more volatile than gold. If you want to be safe, stick 
with gold. It has consistently gone up since 2010, while bitcoin has been 
extremly variable. A volatile stock, though, however more dangerous, also has
the potential to make an exchanger more money, faster. 



## Question 5:

Using the data loaded from Quandl below, plot a time series using `geom_line()`
comparing cheese and milk production in the US from 1930 to today. Comment on this.

* Cheese [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Cheese-Production-Measured-In-Lb)
* Milk [page](https://www.quandl.com/data/USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB-Milk-Production-Measured-In-Lb)

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
cheese <- Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_CHEESEPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>% 
  tbl_df()
milk <-  Quandl("USDANASS/NASS_MILKPRODUCTIONMEASUREDINLB") %>%
